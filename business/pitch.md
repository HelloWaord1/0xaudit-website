## Slide 2: Problem

### The Security Crisis

**$3.8B** was stolen from Web3 protocols in 2024.  
**68%** of exploited protocols had never been audited.  
**23%** had been audited — but their auditor missed the vulnerability.

The security audit industry is broken:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Too slow** | Traditional audits take 4-8 weeks; projects launch in days |
| **Too expensive** | $50K-$200K per audit prices out startups |
| **Too shallow** | Most "audits" are automated scanner reports with a logo |
| **New attack surfaces** | AI agents, cross-chain bridges, and novel DeFi primitives aren't covered by legacy firms |

> **Every day without a proper audit is a day your users' funds are at risk.**

---

## Slide 3: Solution

### AI-Augmented Security Auditing

0xAudit combines **multi-agent AI scanning** with **expert manual review** to deliver audits that are:

🚀 **Faster** — 3-10 days, not 4-8 weeks  
💰 **Affordable** — Starting at $500, not $50K  
🔬 **Deeper** — AI finds patterns; humans find logic flaws  
🤖 **Modern** — Purpose-built for AI agents, DeFi, and Web3  

### How It Works
```
1. Scope Definition    → Client defines targets and priorities
2. AI Multi-Agent Scan → Automated agents scan for 5,000+ vulnerability patterns
3. Manual Expert Review → Human auditor reviews code, logic, and architecture
4. Attack Simulation    → Real exploitation attempts on findings
5. Report & Remediation → Detailed report with fix guidance
6. Retest & Verify     → Confirm fixes are effective
```
