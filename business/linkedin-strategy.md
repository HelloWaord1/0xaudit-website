## Personal Profile: Edward (CEO & Lead Security Auditor)

**Headline:** CEO @ 0xAudit | AI-Powered Security Audits | Protecting Web3 & Web2 from Exploits

**About:**
```
I run 0xAudit — an AI-augmented security firm that finds vulnerabilities before attackers do.

After years in offensive security and smart contract auditing, I built a multi-agent AI system that works alongside human expertise to deliver faster, deeper, and more thorough security audits.

What we do:
• Smart contract audits (Solidity, Rust, Move)
• API & infrastructure security testing
• AI agent security assessments
• Continuous security monitoring

What drives me:
Every dollar stolen in a hack is someone's savings, someone's project, someone's dream. Security isn't optional — it's foundational.

Currently: Scaling 0xAudit to make world-class security accessible to every Web3 project.

### Post 1: Introduction
```
I've spent the last 2 years finding vulnerabilities in smart contracts and web applications.

Here's what I've learned: most exploits aren't sophisticated.

They're the result of:
→ Rushed deployments
→ Skipped security reviews
→ "We'll audit it later" mentality

That's why I built 0xAudit — AI-powered security audits that are fast enough to fit into your development cycle.

No more excuses for shipping insecure code.

If you're building in Web3 or fintech, let's talk about securing your product before launch, not after an incident.

### Post 2: Thought Leadership
```
The security audit industry has a dirty secret:

Most audits are just automated scanner output wrapped in a PDF.

A real security audit should include:
1. Architecture review — understanding how the system actually works
2. Threat modeling — identifying what an attacker would target
3. Manual code review — finding logic bugs scanners can't detect
4. Attack simulation — attempting real exploitation
5. Actionable remediation — not just "fix this," but "here's how"

At 0xAudit, we combine AI automation with every one of these steps.

The result? We find what others miss.

What's your experience with security audits? Have they delivered real value?

### Post 3: Case Study
```
A client came to us after their "audited" smart contract was flagged by a white hat.

The previous audit had missed a critical access control flaw.

Our findings in 72 hours:
🔴 1 Critical — privilege escalation allowing fund drainage
🟠 2 High — front-running vulnerabilities in swap logic
🟡 4 Medium — input validation gaps
🔵 3 Low — gas optimization opportunities

Total cost if exploited: estimated $3.2M

Cost of our audit: $2,000

The ROI of security isn't theoretical. It's mathematical.

### Post 4: AI in Security
```
AI won't replace security auditors.

But security auditors using AI will replace those who don't.

At 0xAudit, our multi-agent AI system:
→ Scans for known vulnerability patterns in seconds
→ Maps attack surfaces automatically
→ Generates preliminary findings for human review
→ Monitors for new threats continuously

The human element remains critical for:
→ Business logic understanding
→ Novel attack vector identification
→ Client communication and remediation guidance

AI + human expertise = the future of security auditing.

```

### Post 5: Industry Insight
```
In 2025, over $1.5B was stolen from Web3 protocols.

The top 3 root causes:
1. Access control failures (38%)
2. Oracle manipulation (22%)
3. Logic errors (18%)

All three are preventable with proper security auditing.

The industry doesn't have a technology problem.
It has a process problem.

Ship fast, but ship secure.

### Post 6: AI Agent Security
```
The next big attack surface? AI agents.

As autonomous agents gain access to APIs, databases, and wallets, they become high-value targets.

Attack vectors we're seeing:
→ Prompt injection through public interfaces
→ Insecure tool/function calling
→ Excessive permissions and missing access controls
→ Data exfiltration through agent responses

At 0xAudit, we've launched a dedicated AI Agent Audit service.

If your agent handles sensitive data or transactions, it needs a security review.

The cost of an audit is a fraction of what a compromised agent could lose.

### Post 7: Hiring/Team
```
Building a security company is really about building trust.

Trust that we'll find what others miss.
Trust that our reports are actionable, not just alarming.
Trust that we'll be there when something goes wrong.

That's why every audit at 0xAudit goes through:
✅ Automated multi-agent AI scanning
✅ Manual expert review
✅ Peer review by a second auditor
✅ Client walkthrough of every finding

Quality isn't a feature. It's the foundation.

#companyculture #security #quality
```

### Post 8: Educational
```
I asked our team: "What's the one thing every developer should do before deploying a smart contract?"

The unanimous answer: write a threat model.

Here's a simple framework:

1. List all actors (users, admins, contracts, oracles)
2. Map all state-changing functions
3. For each function, ask: "What if a malicious actor calls this with unexpected inputs?"
4. Document trust assumptions
5. Review with someone who didn't write the code

This takes 2-4 hours and prevents 80% of critical vulnerabilities.

No tools needed. Just a document and critical thinking.

```

### Post 9: Social Proof
```
Milestone: 0xAudit has now completed XX security audits.

Some numbers I'm proud of:
📊 XXX vulnerabilities identified and remediated
💰 $XXM in client assets protected
⏱️ Average report delivery: 5-7 business days
⭐ 100% of clients received actionable remediation steps

But the number I care about most: $0 lost by our audited clients post-remediation.

Thank you to every client who trusted us with their security.
